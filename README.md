# Java Development Internship Projects - CODSOFT

Welcome to my **Java Development Internship** project repository at **CODSOFT**! ðŸŽ¯  

During this internship, I completed **five practical tasks** that helped me strengthen my skills in **Java, OOP concepts, GUI, API integration, and file handling**.  

Each task demonstrates a different application of Java programming and problem-solving.
